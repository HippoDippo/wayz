# Wayz
A command line tool for creating a basic React project.

## Why
After moving on from Create-React-App, I am becoming more comfortable with webpack and I just wanted a tool to quickly and easily get up and running. I also love building things so yeah.. that too.

## Installation
```
npm install -g wayz
```
or
```
yarn global add wayz
```

## Usage
In your terminal, just type:
```
> wayz appName
```
After that, simply 'cd' into the new project directory, run yarn or npm install, and once it has finished installing everything, run npm start and go check it out at localhost:8080.

Have Fun!
